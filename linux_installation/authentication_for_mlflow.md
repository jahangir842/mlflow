To secure your MLflow server and require authentication for access to the browser UI, you can use a reverse proxy (like **NGINX** or **Apache**) or enable basic authentication using tools like `mlflow`'s built-in options. Here's how you can secure the server:

---

### 1. **Enable Basic Authentication Using a Reverse Proxy**
Set up a reverse proxy to secure access to the MLflow server using **NGINX** or **Apache** with basic authentication.

#### **Using NGINX:**

1. **Install NGINX**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```

2. **Create a Password File**:
   Install the `htpasswd` utility:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2-utils -y
   ```

   Create a password file to store usernames and passwords:
   ```bash
   sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.mlflow_pass username
   ```
   Replace `username` with the desired username. Enter and confirm the password.

3. **Configure NGINX as a Reverse Proxy**:
   Open the NGINX configuration file or create a new one:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mlflow
   ```

   Add the following configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain_or_ip;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

           # Enable basic authentication
           auth_basic "Restricted Access";
           auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.mlflow_pass;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Enable the Configuration**:
   Link the configuration file and restart NGINX:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mlflow /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

   Access MLflow via `http://your_domain_or_ip`, and it will prompt for a username and password.

---

### 2. **Use MLflow Built-in Authentication (Token-Based)**
MLflow itself does not support user authentication natively. However, you can integrate it with an identity provider or secure access using a token-based system.

1. **Run MLflow with an Authentication Token**:
   Use a tool like `flask` or `gunicorn` to wrap the MLflow app with authentication middleware. For example:

   Create a Python script to serve MLflow with authentication:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, abort
   from mlflow.server import app

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.before_request
   def basic_auth():
       auth = request.authorization
       if not auth or not (auth.username == "username" and auth.password == "password"):
           abort(401)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
   ```

   Replace `username` and `password` with your desired credentials. Run this script instead of the default `mlflow server` command.

2. **Run MLflow Using Gunicorn**:
   ```bash
   gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 my_mlflow_app:app
   ```

### 3. **Integrate with OAuth or Identity Provider**
For enterprise-grade authentication, consider integrating MLflow with OAuth2 providers (e.g., Google, Okta) or using services like AWS Cognito.

This typically involves:

- Deploying MLflow behind a reverse proxy (e.g., AWS ALB, NGINX) with OAuth authentication.
- Configuring the reverse proxy to handle authentication and forward authenticated requests to the MLflow server.

---

### Summary
- **For Basic Authentication**: Use NGINX as a reverse proxy with `htpasswd`.
- **For Token-Based Access**: Wrap MLflow in a Flask app with basic auth middleware.
- **For Advanced Authentication**: Use OAuth2 or an external identity provider.

Choose the method that best fits your team's security and scalability needs!
