#### Step 2: Install MLflow Server (From Control Node)

To deploy the MLflow server, first ensure your `inventory.yml` is correctly configured with the appropriate host details.

Then, execute the following Ansible playbooks in the order listed below:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ./playbooks/network_setup.yml

```

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ./playbooks/packages.yml
```

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ./playbooks/firewall.yml
```

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ./playbooks/nfs_setup.yml
```

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ./playbooks/mlflow.yml
```

Each playbook addresses a specific aspect of the deployment processâ€”ranging from network configuration to package installation, firewall rules, NFS setup, and finally the MLflow server deployment. This structured approach ensures a consistent, automated, and reliable MLflow environment.
