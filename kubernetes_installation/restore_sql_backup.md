To restore an SQL backup to your PostgreSQL pod in your MLflow Kubernetes setup, you’ll need to transfer the backup file to the pod and then use PostgreSQL’s tools (`psql` or `pg_restore`, depending on your backup format) to restore it. Below is a step-by-step guide tailored to your setup.

---

### Prerequisites
1. **SQL Backup File**: Ensure you have your SQL backup file (e.g., `backup_mlflow.dump`) available on your local machine or a location accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.
2. **kubectl**: Ensure `kubectl` is configured to interact with your cluster and the `mlflow` namespace is active (`kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=mlflow`).
3. **Backup Format**: Confirm whether your backup is a plain SQL file (restorable with `psql`) or a binary dump (restorable with `pg_restore`). The steps differ slightly based on this.

---

### Step 1: Identify the PostgreSQL Pod
1. List the pods in the `mlflow` namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n mlflow
   ```
   Look for the pod name starting with `postgres-` (e.g., `postgres-abcdef-12345`).

2. Set the pod name as a variable for convenience:
   ```bash
   POSTGRES_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n mlflow -l app=postgres -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
   echo $POSTGRES_POD
   ```

---

### Step 2: Copy the SQL Backup to the PostgreSQL Pod
1. **Copy the File**:
   Use `kubectl cp` to transfer your backup file from your local machine to the pod. Replace `/path/to/backup_mlflow.dump` with the actual path to your SQL file:
   ```bash
   kubectl cp /path/to/backup_mlflow.dump $POSTGRES_POD:/tmp/backup_mlflow.dump -n mlflow
   ```

### Steps to Restore the Custom-Format Dump

#### Step 1: Ensure a Clean Database
To avoid conflicts, drop and recreate the `mlflowdb` database after terminating any active connections.

1. **Exec into the PostgreSQL Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it $POSTGRES_POD -n mlflow -- bash
   ```

2. **Verify the File Transfer**:
   Exec into the pod to confirm the file is present:
   ```bash
   ls /tmp/backup_mlflow.dump
   ```
   If the file exists, proceed. Exit the pod with `exit`.



2. **Terminate Active Connections to `mlflowdb`**:
   Run this command to kill all active connections to the `mlflowdb` database:
   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mlflowdb';"
   ```
   - Enter `pakistan` as the password when prompted.
   - This ensures no sessions block the drop operation. You might see output like a count of terminated connections or no output if there were none.

3. **Drop the Existing Database**:
   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE mlflowdb;"
   ```
   - This should now succeed since all connections are terminated.

4. **Recreate the Database**:
   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE mlflowdb;"
   ```

5. **Enable the `uuid-ossp` Extension** (required by MLflow):
   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d mlflowdb -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\";"
   ```

#### Step 2: Restore the Backup with `pg_restore`
Your `backup_mlflow.dump` is a custom-format dump, so use `pg_restore` to restore it.

1. **Restore the Custom-Format Dump**:
   ```bash
   pg_restore -U admin -d mlflowdb --verbose /tmp/backup_mlflow.dump
   ```
   - `--verbose`: Provides detailed output to confirm the restore process.
   - Enter `pakistan` as the password when prompted.
   - With a fresh database, this should restore the schema and data without conflicts.

2. **Verify the Restore**:
   Check the tables:
   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d mlflowdb -c "\dt"
   ```
   - Expected output: Tables like `experiments`, `runs`, `metrics`, etc.
   - Optionally, check some data:
     ```bash
     psql -U admin -d mlflowdb -c "SELECT * FROM experiments LIMIT 5;"
     ```

3. **Exit the Pod**:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

#### Step 3: Clean Up
Remove the temporary backup file:
```bash
kubectl exec $POSTGRES_POD -n mlflow -- rm /tmp/backup_mlflow.dump
```

#### Step 4: Restart MLflow (Optional)
Restart the MLflow deployment to ensure it connects to the restored database:
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/mlflow -n mlflow
```

#### Step 5: Verify MLflow UI
- Access `http://<node-ip>:30500` and confirm that your experiments, runs, and other data from the backup are visible.

### Simplifying with `PGPASSWORD`
To avoid entering the password repeatedly:
1. Inside the pod, set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export PGPASSWORD=pakistan
   ```
2. Then run the commands without password prompts:
   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mlflowdb';"
   psql -U admin -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE mlflowdb;"
   psql -U admin -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE mlflowdb;"
   psql -U admin -d mlflowdb -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\";"
   pg_restore -U admin -d mlflowdb --verbose /tmp/backup_mlflow.dump
   ```

---

### Troubleshooting
1. **Restore Fails with Errors**:
   - Share the `pg_restore --verbose` output if it fails. Possible issues:
     - Missing extension: Ensure `uuid-ossp` is created (Step 1.5).
     - Permission errors: Verify the `admin` user owns the database:
       ```bash
       psql -U admin -d postgres -c "ALTER DATABASE mlflowdb OWNER TO admin;"
       ```

2. **Connections Still Blocking**:
   - If `DROP DATABASE` still fails with `database "mlflowdb" is being accessed by other users` after terminating connections, exclude the current session explicitly:
     ```bash
     psql -U admin -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mlflowdb' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();"
     ```
     Then retry the drop.

3. **MLflow Not Reflecting Data**:
   - Check MLflow logs:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -f deployment/mlflow -n mlflow
     ```
   - Ensure the `--backend-store-uri` is correct (`postgresql://admin:pakistan@postgres:5432/mlflowdb`).

4. **File Format Confusion**:
   - If `pg_restore` fails with an unexpected error, double-check the file:
     ```bash
     head /tmp/backup_mlflow.dump
     ```
     - It should start with `PGDMP` for a custom-format dump. If it’s plain SQL instead, use:
       ```bash
       psql -U admin -d mlflowdb -f /tmp/backup_mlflow.dump
       ```

### Next Steps
Run the steps above and share the output, especially from `pg_restore --verbose` or any errors encountered. Since we’ve confirmed `backup_mlflow.dump` is a custom-format dump, `pg_restore` on a fresh database should work smoothly. Let me know how it goes!
